			<p>There is a definite huge gap in the market for a quick and easy way to see what&#8217;s going on whilst you get ready, without having to look at your phone and then get distracted on Facebook, Clash of Clans, or an email.</p>

			<p>The question is: is this that useful? And by that, I mean sure, the weather is quite important&#8230; but is it really? I can tell you roughly what the weather will be by the month of the year; December will be cold, take a coat, July will be warm, rock a tee with shorts. The time&#8230; sure, but there&#8217;s your watch and your phone to tell you that instantly. News stories… you&#8217;re there to get ready, not know that Apple have just announced a new MacBook. The one area this interests me is with your calendar; showing you a schedule of what&#8217;s happening is really cool and one where you might have forgotten to do something.</p>

			<p>I would imagine this is an in-between phase. The ideal solution would be something you can talk and interact with, without having to &#8220;look&#8221; at it. Kind of like Google Now, how you can say &#8220;OK, Google, what will the weather be like today&#8221; and it responds accordingly. Think Star Trek, or Galaxy Quest, with a computer ready to fetch and dictate information. Making it extensible would be awesome, imagine saying &#8220;Ok, Google, what&#8217;s my day like?&#8221; and it responds with:</p>

			<blockquote>
				<p>Hi Chris, you have a meeting with Steve this morning in Bath. Traffic is pretty heavy so you&#8217;ll need to leave in 20 minutes to get there on time. Don&#8217;t forget to take an umbrella and coat, it&#8217;s likely to rain and will have a high of 16 degrees. It&#8217;s your mum&#8217;s birthday today, grab some flowers on the way home.</p>
			</blockquote
			>
			<p>Like the PC, there&#8217;ll be one of these in every home in 20 years time. Now, where&#8217;s my chequebook, I need to invest in something…</p>
