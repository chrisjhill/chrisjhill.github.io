			<p>I don’t believe in “mystic” or “fortunes”, however I recently took the 16 personalities test, based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator">Myers–Briggs Type Indicator</a> and was pleasantly surprised with how accurate it seems. It says that I am an INFJ, apparently making me the rarest type: only around 1% of the population. INFJ: Introversion, Intuition, Feeling, and Judging.</p>

			<p>I walk alongside other INFJ&#8217;s such as Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela, and Mother Teresa.</p>

			<h2>General overview of an INFJ</h2>

			<blockquote>
				<p>As Diplomats, they have an inborn sense of idealism and morality, but what sets them apart is the accompanying Judging trait – INFJs are not idle dreamers, but people capable of taking concrete steps to realize their goals and make a lasting positive impact. Though soft-spoken, they have very strong opinions and will fight tirelessly for an idea they believe in. They are decisive and strong-willed, but will rarely use that energy for personal gain</p>
			</blockquote>
			
			<h2>INFJ as a leader</h2>
			
			<blockquote>
				<p>INFJs are often reluctant in exercising their authority, preferring to see their subordinates as equals, coordinating and supervising people, and working hard to inspire and motivate, not to crack the whip. That’s not to say that people with the INFJ personality type have lax standards – far from it – as INFJs’ sense of equality means that they expect their subordinates to be as competent, motivated and reliable as the INFJs themselves.</p>
			</blockquote>
