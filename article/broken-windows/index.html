		<h1>Broken Windows</h1>

		<p style="background:#f7f7f7;border-left:4px solid #ff6961;border-radius:5px;padding:1rem;">
		This is an old post from 2016. As such, it might not be relevant anymore.</p>
		</p>

		<div class="article__single_content">
			<p>There is an interesting theory that came around in 1982 by two American social scientists named James Wilson and George Kelling called &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory">Broken Windows</a>&#8220;. This stated that maintaining law and order quickly in urban areas would result in fewer crimes and de-escalating crimes of severity. Their paper stated:</p>

			<blockquote>
				<p>Consider a building with a few broken windows. If the windows are not repaired, the tendency is for vandals to break a few more windows. Eventually, they may even break into the building, and if it&#8217;s unoccupied, perhaps become squatters or light fires inside.</p>

				<p>
					Or consider a pavement. Some litter accumulates. Soon, more litter accumulates. Eventually, people even start leaving bags of refuse from take-out restaurants there or even break into cars.<br />

					<cite><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1982/03/broken-windows/304465/">Broken Windows, the police and neighborhood safety</a></cite>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			
			<p>So how does this tie into Web Development? Like the example above, if there are &#8220;bad things&#8221; in the code then developers will be more likely to further contaminate that file with &#8220;bad&#8221; things&#8221;, because the file already needs a refactor. But that refactor will happen next week/month/year (never, most likely) and everything will be right again in the world. So there&#8217;s no sense in doing that now and blowing the deadline for the whole project which needs to be shipped in 2 weeks.</p>
			
			<p>Sound familiar?</p>
			
			<p>This solution doesn&#8217;t make sense for most programming languages, but it does for CSS due to its weird specificity and cascading nature. You have a new file for each project named <var>shame.css</var> which contains all of the hacks that you have had to add in order to ship on time. This is great because of several reasons:</p>
			
			<ol>
				<li>All of your hacks are self contained within a single file, not contaminating the rest of the sane code.</li>
				<li>You are admitting there are hacks, but each hack should have its own comment saying why it&#8217;s necessary, what it does, and how it can be fixed.</li>
				<li>Have a spare hour? You can easily dive straight in and fix a hack.</li>
				<li>You can see who was responsible for the hacks (<var>$ git blame -l shame.css</var>).</li>
			</ol>

			<p>The forth point is actually not a blame game, but you can possibly spot trends. If one developer is making a lot of hacks with regards to, say, the grid system then they may need to be given a quick chat on how it works and what they were doing wrong &#8211; this will make them more productive in the future.</p>
			
			<p>It&#8217;s also a file where someone who isn&#8217;t that well versed in CSS can place a snippet, knowing that someone will come along and implement it correctly in the codebase in the future.</p>
